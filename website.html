            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am currently a Master's student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. My interests are primarily in robotics and design. I started working with soft robotic actuators in high school and have continued to pursue this field throughout my academic career. My experience in research has been extremely fulfilling and has led me to pursue my Master's degree with the hope of continuing to work on emerging technologies.</p>
